If reports contain project which are generated against same source code, then they are merged together into a single node. For example, if one report is generated against net481 and another against net8.0, then merged report contains coverage statistics covered by both target frameworks.

Framework Report | Core Report | Merged Report
--- | --- | ---

Different report formats can be merged as well. However, data is added or removed required for the merged report (e.g. blocks coverage is not available in cobertura report.).
