# Microsoft code coverage tools

Microsoft code coverage functionality is closed source. This repository contains documentation and samples. You can also use it to report any issues related to `Microsoft.CodeCoverage` NuGet package, `dotnet-coverage` NuGet package or Visual Studio code coverage functionality.

## Get started

To collect code coverage for .NET test project you can simply execute:

```shell
dotnet new mstest -o mstests
cd mstests
dotnet test --collect "Code Coverage;Format=cobertura"
```

You should see output:

```shell
Determining projects to restore...
  All projects are up-to-date for restore.
  mstests -> D:\mstests\bin\Debug\net8.0\mstests.dll
Test run for D:\mstests\bin\Debug\net8.0\mstests.dll (.NETCoreApp,Version=v8.0)

Starting test execution, please wait...
A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.

```

For any .NET application you can collect code coverage in this way:

```shell
dotnet new console -o sample1
cd sample1
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-coverage
dotnet-coverage collect "dotnet run"
```

You should see output:

```shell
dotnet-coverage v17.13.1.0 [win-x64 - .NET 9.0.2]

SessionId: d1bf31db-f634-4b2c-a627-c708ac93d85b
Hello, World!
Code coverage results: output.coverage.
```

For existing projects to get latest features and best performance please keep up to date below references:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.13.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeCoverage" Version="17.13.0" />
```

If your solution doesn't contain any C++ code it is recommended to disable native code coverage by adding into configuration below flags:

```xml
<EnableStaticNativeInstrumentation>False</EnableStaticNativeInstrumentation>
<EnableDynamicNativeInstrumentation>False</EnableDynamicNativeInstrumentation>
```

Check other configuration options [here](docs/configuration.md).
